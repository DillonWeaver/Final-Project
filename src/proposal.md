## Title
Art by Numbers: The Digital Museum

## Github Link
https://github.com/DillonWeaver/Final-Project.git

## Description
This project will revolve around using the turtle drawing multiple pieces or artwork to serve within a digital museum. 
Everything will revolve around a complex system of user inputs that allows them to chose each work and also learn something surrounding the art.

## Features
- Feature 1: The Art
	- I will use the turtle program to create multiple pieces of art that can be called at the request of the user.
- Feature 2: The Interface
	- An entire curated experience tailored to the user will be created so that the code emulates being guided through a museum.
    This will be done through functions and strings correlating to certain artworks being called alongside them.
- Feature 3: The Atmosphere  
	- More visual interest will guide the user's interest within the interface itself. 
    Custom ASCII titles, sequenced timing and potentially images and random functions all added to expand the scope of interactivity.

## Challenges
- I'll have to greatly research further using the turtle program, upgrading from simple shapes to quality art.
- The way I sequence the museum progression will need me to develop a stronger understanding of organizing functions
and inputs so that nothing overlaps and that the user has total control over what is called.
- I will research on means of presenting the museum, adding whatever details that can enhance the visuals of the
terminal of even going beyond it and making the program more contained in a single visual.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is a fully interactive digital museum that displays turtle art of classic works and information about them.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A system that allows the user to select prompts that are made into a turtle artwork along with printed information about the image.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up functions and code that allows total user control over the museum's flow.
  2. Integrate imported libraries to ensure they're called with each input.

- Week 2
  1. Create the museum system that guides the user through the experience.
  2. Practice coordinate systems and details with turtle to begin making art.

- Week N (Final)
  1. Fully integrate artwork into the museum (5 works).
  2. Add custom artwork and potential video to the intro/outro of museum.
  3. Revise all aspects of the code for the final submission.
